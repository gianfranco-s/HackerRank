### Permutations: when order matters

$$ _x P_r = { n! \over (n-r)! } $$

$n$: total number of elements  
$r$: amount of objects considered at a time

### Combinations: when order does not matter

$$ _x C_r = { _x P_r \over r!} = { n! \over r! \cdot (n-r)! = \binom{n}{r} } $$

$n$: total number of elements  
$r$: amount of objects considered at a time
